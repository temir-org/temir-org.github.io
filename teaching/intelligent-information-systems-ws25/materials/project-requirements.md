# Project Requirements

## Engineering
- At least 3 agents collaborating, with distinct roles
- Tool implementations that are needed & called (via MCP server)
- Guardrails for input/output
- (optional) Integration of an external data source (via tool calling)

## Research
- Formulate a research question that your agentic system should address
- Find or generate test data for this research question
- Test the final system (statistical tests)
- Conduct ablation studies, and compare different system configurations

## Report
- 6 pages, with unlimited additional pages for references and appendix.
- Format in official ACM template (available for both LaTeX and Word); it should be single-column layout with no copyright notice. For LaTeX, this can be achieved by setting `\documentclass[manuscript]{acmart}` and `\setcopyright{none}` in the preamble.
- Should (1) outline your research question; (2) review related work; (3) motivate your methodological choices; (4) provide quantitative evaluation of system.
