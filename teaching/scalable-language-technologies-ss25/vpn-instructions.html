    <h2>Usage</h2>
    <p>The *.ovpn file you download contains both your VPN configuration as well as your private key and certificate
        and can be used to connect to the VPN.<br><em>Please keep the file in a secure location and contact an
            administrator in case your certificate was compromised!</em></p>

            <h3>Linux (Command Line)</h3>
    
            <p>Install <code>openvpn</code>:</p>
            <pre><code>sudo apt install openvpn</code></pre>
            <p>Load the *.ovpn file (<code>sudo</code> may be required):</p>
            <pre><code>openvpn *.ovpn</code></pre>
            <p>You will have access to the VPN as long as you don't stop the <code>openvpn</code> process
                (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd> or close the terminal). Note that DNS settings will not necessarily be
                applied with this method. If you want to resolve other hosts in the VPN, add <code>10.141.0.1</code>
                as a DNS server to your network configuration.</p>
    
            <h3>Linux (Network Manager)</h3>
    
            <p>Install the OpenVPN module for the NetworkManager:</p>
            <pre><code>sudo apt install network-manager-openvpn</code></pre>
    
            <p>If you are using Gnome as your desktop, you may also want to install</p>
            <pre><code>sudo apt install network-manager-openvpn-gnome</code></pre>
            <p>Import the *.ovpn file with</p>
            <pre><code>nmcli connection import type openvpn file *.ovpn</code></pre>
            <p>You can also import it via a NetworkManager GUI frontend by adding a new connection
                and choosing <em>Import VPN connection...</em> (screen shot taken on KDE, Gnome differs slightly).</p>
            <img src="http://auth.webis.de/static/img/pki/linux-nm-kde.png" style="max-width: 100%" alt="KDE import OVPN file">
            <p>Now use your desktop's NetworkManager applet in the tray to activate the VPN connection.</p>
            <p><strong>Important:</strong> Due to a <del>bug</del> feature in NetworkManager, you may experience that
                you cannot access anything except the University network after activating the VPN.
                If that is the case, edit the VPN connection, click <em>IPv4</em> and then <em>Routes</em>.
                Check the box for <em>Use only for resources on this connection</em> (or similar).
            </p><p>You can also change this option on the command line:</p>
            <pre><code>nmcli connection modify "Connection Name" ipv4.never-default true</code></pre>
            <p>where <code>"Connection Name"</code> is the name of your VPN connection (defaults to the name
                of the *.ovpn file, but you can change it to whatever you like).</p>

        <div>
            <h3>Windows</h3>
            <p>Download <a href="https://openvpn.net/client-connect-vpn-for-windows/" target="_blank">OpenVPN Connect for Windows</a>, install and
                start it. Then click <em>File</em> and select your *.ovpn file. In the following dialog make sure all information
                is correct and then click <em>Save</em>. When the file has been imported successfully, click the toggle button to activate the VPN and enter your chosen password
                to decrypt your private key.</p>
            <img src="http://auth.webis.de/static/img/pki/windows-1.png" style="max-width: 49%" alt="Windows Import File">
            <img src="http://auth.webis.de/static/img/pki/windows-2.png" style="max-width: 49%" alt="Windows Connect">
            <p>Afterwards, you can safely close the window. OpenVPN will keep running in the background and can be accessed at
                any time from its icon in the system tray in the bottom right corner. From there you can also easily connect
                and disconnect via the right-click context menu.</p>
    
            <h3>macOS</h3>
            <p>On macOS, you can download <a href="https://openvpn.net/client-connect-vpn-for-mac-os/">OpenVPN Connect for Mac OS</a>.
                For usage instructions, please refer to the Windows section above.</p>
            <p>If preferred, you can also use the open-source software <a href="https://tunnelblick.net/" target="_blank">Tunnelblick</a>
                instead of the official macOS client. For further information, please refer to the Tunnelblick documentation.</p>
    
            <h3>Android / iOS</h3>
            <p>Download OpenVPN Connect from the
                <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.openvpn.openvpn" style="max-width: 100%" target="_blank">Google Play Store</a>
                or <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/openvpn-connect-openvpn-app/id590379981" style="max-width: 100%" target="_blank">Apple App Store</a>,
                click the <em>OVPN Profile</em> button (or the little "+" icon at the bottom)
                and select the *.ovpn file from your phone's storage. After activating the connection
                for the first time, you have to confirm that OpenVPN may add itself as a VPN to your
                system. Please note that no two VPNs can run at the same time on both Android and iOS.</p>
