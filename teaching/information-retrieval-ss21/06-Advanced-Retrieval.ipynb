    "\n",
    "Here, $P(\\pmb{q})$ can be omitted without affecting the relative ranking of all documents (i.e. omitting it influences all scores equally), and $P(\\pmb{d})$ is assumed uniform, cancelling its influence.\n",
    "\n",
    "The query representation $\\pmb{q}$ can be written as sequence of $t_1, ..., t_{|q|}$ of index terms, which (under the assumption that terms are independent of each other) allows us to rewrite the equation as follows:\n",
    "\n",
